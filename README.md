[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.2-yellow)](#)

## 📝 Description
Extremely simple NodeJS library for listing and validating links within a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file.


## 🚀 Objective
Get to know the fundamentals of NodeJS and creating libs with the framework.

## 📌 Important Note
This project was developed and tested only on version **14.19.1** of NodeJS. Make sure you are using the same version to avoid conflicts. In the future, greater compatibility with newer versions should be implemented. No module system of current ECMAScript was used.

```


## 🔎 How to use
